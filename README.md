## Code less, backtest more !

#### Backtest a trading strategy can be really boring, once you designed & coded your strategy you need a set of tools to backtest it. You have to collect market data, run your strategy using a fake exchange, parse all orders and calculate a lot of data. 

##### Backtest+ will provide this set of tools ! fake exchange to handle spot, margin, future and advanced orders types but also a powerful data parser and others features

##### Backtest+ is a part of [Shaft Crypto Trading Set](https://github.com/Shaft-3796/Shaft-Crypto-Trading-Set) and it will take the place of [Open Backtest](https://github.com/Shaft-3796/OpenBacktest)
